   * This means that for a sequence of N snapshots, only the latest (most recent) snapshot is
   * needed, since it would overwrite all of the intervening snapshots when it is ultimately
   * applied.
   *
   * Given this, save has the followings semantics:
   * 1) If there is no in-flight/pending save operation, then save the current snapshot immediately
   * 2) If there is a pending save operation, wait until the operation completes and then save
   *    the latest snapshot, regardless of the number of save() calls that happened in the interim.
   *
   * This strategy ensures that conflicting writes aren't issued concurrently and that the latest
   * notebook state is updated as soon as possible upon completion of pending writes.

<h1>Welcome to Google Datalab!</h1>

It appears your Datalab container is not yet set up correctly. These
are the steps needed:

<ul>
<li>Install gcloud, and run 'gcloud auth login' to log in to Google's cloud services. This should create a 
.config/gcloud directory in your home directory.</li>
<li>Set up the two volumes in the containers settings in Kitematic. The 'home' volume should
point to your home directory (typically shown as '~' when set) 
and the 'notebooks' volume should point to the root directory
of where you want to store your notebooks.</li>
<li>If you have not yet done so, create a datalab directory in your notebooks folder and 
clone the samples and tutorials.</li>
</ul>

Once complete, restart the container and try again.

    "TensorFlow gets its name from [tensors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensor), which are arrays of arbitrary dimensionality. A vector is a 1-d array and is known as a 1st-order tensor. A matrix is a 2-d array and a 2nd-order tensor. The \"flow\" part of the name refers to computation flowing through a graph. A neural network is largely a series of matrix operations, which TensorFlow represents at a fairly low level compared to DistBelief. The flexibility and potential for optimization of this lower level representation is the major difference between DistBelief and TensorFlow.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you think of doing things in TensorFlow, you might want to think of creating tensors (like matrices), adding operations (that output other tensors), and then executing the computation (running the computational graph). In particular, it's important to realize that when you add an operation on tensors, it doesn't execute immediately, but TensorFlow waits for you to add all the operations you want to do. Then it optimizes the computation graph, combining operations and picking where to run them, before generating the data. Because of this, a tensor in TensorFlow isn't so much holding the data as a placeholder for holding the data, waiting for the data to arrive when computation is run."

A session holds the computation graph, which contains the tensors and the operations. When you create tensors and operations, they are not executed immediately, but wait for other operations and tensors to be added to the graph, only executing when finally requested to produce the results of the session.\n",

    "The next two lines create tensors using a convenience function called [constant](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/master/api_docs/python/constant_op.html#constant), which is similar to numpy's array() and numpy's `full`. In summary, it creates a tensor of the necessary shape and applies the constant operator to it to fill it with the provided values. The values to `constant` can be python or numpy arrays. `constant` can take an optional shape paramter, which works similarly to numpy's `fill` if provided, and an optional name parameter, which can be used to put a more human-readable label on the operation in the TensorFlow operation graph.\n",

It returns this as a numpy array, which can then be printed. But, it's important to realize it also runs the computation graph at this point, because we demanded the output from the operation node of the graph; to produce that, it had to run the computation graph. So, this is the point where the addition is actually performed, not when `add` was called, as `add` just put the addition operation into the TensorFlow computation graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "Whew! Did you understand all of that? If you did, great, you're ready to go on. If it still sounds hazy, the important part is that, unlike the Python and numpy examples, the TensorFlow example doesn't execute the addition immediately, but waits until the computation graph is executed."

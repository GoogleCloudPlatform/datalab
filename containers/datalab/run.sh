# This script allows running the docker container locally.
# Passing the 'shell' flag causes the docker container to break into a
# command prompt, rather than run the node.js server, which is useful
# for tinkering within the container before manually starting the server.

# In local mode the container picks up local notebooks, so it can be used
# to work on files saved on the file system.

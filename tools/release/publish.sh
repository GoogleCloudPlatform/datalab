# This script defines the publishing step of the Datalab release process.
#
# It assumes that a daily build has been built using the `build.sh` script,
# updates the main tags for the images to the given build, and then updates
# the config_local.js file in Google Cloud Storage.

# The script supports two (optional) environment variables that can be
# defined externally to modify its behavior:
#
#  1. "PROJECT_ID": Sets the name of the target project where the
#     images will be pulled from and pushed to. Defaults to "cloud-datalab"
#  2. "BUILD": The label of the builds to pull down and publish. If omitted
#     this will default to the current date (which is what the build.sh
#     script uses by default).
